In the US, aided by an iPod commercial featuring the song, and presence on the latest successful \"Now\" compilation, \"Feel Good Inc.\" took Gorillaz to a whole new level - the track peaked just outside the top 10 in the Billboard Top 100, and it was also top of the Modern Rock charts for a 3 week spell. In the UK, due to a loophole in the chart rules, Feel Good Inc was able to enter the charts before its official release because the record company released 300 copies of the 7-inch single format, meaning that legal downloads would count towards a chart placing for the single ( this was because, according to UK chart rules at that time, a single could only chart if a physical format was available, although download sales contributed to chart placings). A total of 4 new and original songs were available across formats, although \"Murdoc is God\" was only included on the Japanese CD. The feel of the B-sides was more free and experimental than that of those that had appeared on 'Demon Days' - showcasing another side to the Gorillaz sound. Also, \"Feel Good Inc.\" makes an appearance in Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party 3 on Wii And Grand Theft Auto 5 On Xbox One, Playstaion 4 And PC Versions.","username":"Everything Gorillaz - P2","media":{"url":"https://api-mobile.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:231321623/f4b05b90-473f-4ef0-b354-dbd559bb255e/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":214850,"snipped":false,"type":"stream","format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq","loudness_normalization":{"input_i":-10.35,"input_tp":0.75,"input_lra":6.1,"input_threshold":-20.69,"target_i":-23,"target_tp":-1,"target_lra":-1,"target_threshold":-1}}},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:255766528","title":"Stronger","image":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-fh5V0ShP2faM-0-t300x300.jpg","duration":312424,"username":"Kanye West","media":{"url":"https://api-mobile.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:255766528/f2086765-d33e-4e64-83ef-13734690fd83/preview/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_1","duration":30000,"snipped":true,"type":"snip-preview","format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq","loudness_normalization":{"input_i":-10.97,"input_tp":-2.56,"input_lra":2.2,"input_threshold":-21.01,"target_i":-23,"target_tp":-1,"target_lra":-1,"target_threshold":-1}}},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:231155880","title":"Clint Eastwood","image":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000134745984-h9hqai-t300x300.jpg","duration":332490,"description":"Clint Eastwood was Gorillaz' first proper single. A huge smash initially in the UK, where it remained in the charts for months and the top 10 for weeks. At around the same time radio in Europe also went mad for the song. Slightly later in 2001 the song would also become a massive radio hit in the US and central and South America. Bigger than his previous smash, Song 2 (with Blur), this song remains Damon Albarn's biggest hit. In the UK the Ed Case Refix (available on all formats) actually got far more airplay than the A-side, probably resulting in the inclusion of said remix on the debut LP. B-side Dracula was probably the best of the off cuts from the 'Gorillaz' sessions, and tour rap group Phi Life Cypher also contributed a version.","username":"Everything Gorillaz - P1","media":{"url":"https://api-mobile.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:231155880/9848bf0d-0475-4055-b765-d8538dea2f56/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":332490,"snipped":false,"type":"stream","format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq","loudness_normalization":{"input_i":-10.29,"input_tp":0.61,"input_lra":2.4,"input_threshold":-20.51,"target_i":-23,"target_tp":-1,"target_lra":-1,"target_threshold":-1}}},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:6466553","title":"M I A - Paper Planes","image":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000002786585-39qiu5-t300x300.jpg","duration":205400,"description":"","username":"Diplo","media":{"url":"https://api-mobile.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:6466553/ed890c07-0c2c-426b-bbf9-64ef4e1119e4/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":205400,"snipped":false,"type":"stream","format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq","loudness_normalization":{"input_i":-9.54,"input_tp":1.33,"input_lra":2.5,"input_threshold":-19.57,"target_i":-23,"target_tp":-1,"target_lra":-1,"target_threshold":-1}}},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:255766429","title":"Heartless","image":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-KhcKNfjUb4AY-0-t300x300.jpg","duration":211043,"username":"Kanye West","media":{"url":"https://api-mobile.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:255766429/386f744c-00a6-4e47-818e-65fb5f9d3329/preview/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_1","duration":30000,"snipped":true,"type":"snip-preview","format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq","loudness_normalization":{"input_i":-8.28,"input_tp":0.45,"input_lra":2.5,"input_threshold":-18.38,"target_i":-23,"target_tp":-1,"target_lra":-1,"target_threshold":-1}}},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:345564816","title":"Crazy","image":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000245807279-mu6xzy-t300x300.jpg","duration":125347,"description":"","username":"Lil Pump","media":{"url":"https://api-mobile.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:345564816/9c4d6c08-d75d-4b88-81a6-87abff49d69b/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":125347,"snipped":false,"type":"stream","format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq","loudness_normalization":{"input_i":-7.99,"input_tp":0.14,"input_lra":3.7,"input_threshold":-18.37,"target_i":-23,"target_tp":-1,"target_lra":-1,"target_threshold":-1}}},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:256214037","title":"Lollipop","image":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-rkcz8yOYIzE8-0-t300x300.jpg","duration":183562,"username":"MikaSounds","media":{"url":"https://api-mobile.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:256214037/95454e3f-bfab-449f-ae0b-f31096163475/preview/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_1","duration":30000,"snipped":true,"type":"snip-preview","format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq","loudness_normalization":{"input_i":-8.08,"input_tp":2.61,"input_lra":7.8,"input_threshold":-18.21,"target_i":-23,"target_tp":-1,"target_lra":-1,"target_threshold":-1}}},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:231322140","title":"DARE","image":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000498995223-3b1m7n-t300x300.jpg","duration":237266,"description":"DARE (挑戦 in Japanese) is a single featured as the twelfth track on the 2005 album Demon Days.\n\nAs early as Demon Days leaked, fans and critics were picking DARE as having 'single' written all over it. It was a surprise to nobody when it was plucked from the album to be the follow-up to the smash hit 'Feel Good Inc.' DARE crashed into the UK charts at #1, becoming the first Gorillaz single to do so. Bonus tracks were spread generously over the 3 formats in the UK, the standouts being the excellent 'Highway (Under Construction)' and the early version of DARE, 'People'. Several big-name remixers were enlisted to corner every possible DJ angle, resulting in some interesting takes on the song (some of these were available on promos and as legal downloads only). All in all DARE represented an excellent package for the fans; and with its catchy lines and stunning video the title song was also a deserved hit worldwide.","username":"Everything Gorillaz - P2","media":{"url":"https://api-mobile.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:231322140/f76496fb-c4f2-4393-9654-815bbc73eb74/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":237266,"snipped":false,"type":"stream","format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq","loudness_normalization":{"input_i":-10.91,"input_tp":2.48,"input_lra":2.9,"input_threshold":-21,"target_i":-23,"target_tp":-1,"target_lra":-1,"target_threshold":-1}}},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:16480693","title":"I Gotta Feeling -
