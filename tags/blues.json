Francesco Yates, set for release on Friday, September 11th. \n\nSampling the 2003 Baby Bash single ‘Suga Suga’, Schulz’ ’Sugar’  is pure summer; with a smooth groove, softly bouncing beat and silky vocals from Canadian singer songwriter Francesco Yates. Enlisted for remix duty, EDX  layers punchy percussion over an intensified beat and the result is an irresistible dance floor hit with all the charm and groove of the original. \n\nIt’s clear from this latest offering that Italian/Swiss producer EDX is showing no signs of slowing down - with quality release after quality release, a Beatport chart topper under his belt this year with his remix of Sons of Maria and Nora en Pure’s ‘Uruguay’, the uber hit remix for Sam Feldt’s \"Show Me Love\" still growing into summer biggest anthem and a rigorous touring schedule that sees him playing at high profile nightclubs and major festivals around the globe. \n\nBeatport: TBA\nItunes pre-order: https://goo.gl/O10Yut\nYoutube Video Robin Schulz - Teaser: https://goo.gl/CMBt4c","username":"EDX","media":{"url":"https://api-mobile.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:222238653/0018901e-6c53-407c-a474-404da223a397/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":179842,"snipped":false,"type":"stream","format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq","loudness_normalization":{"input_i":-6.73,"input_tp":3.01,"input_lra":3.3,"input_threshold":-16.98,"target_i":-23,"target_tp":-1,"target_lra":-1,"target_threshold":-1}}},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:326293297","title":"Folsom Prison Blues","image":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-h4oieEhstFwe-0-t300x300.jpg","duration":170881,"username":"Johnny Cash","media":{"url":"https://api-mobile.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:326293297/b09cc0a0-256f-4d49-b83c-9d0c980d109d/preview/progressive","preset":"mp3_0_0","duration":30000,"snipped":true,"type":"snip-preview","format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq","loudness_normalization":{"input_i":-15.33,"input_tp":-0.74,"input_lra":3.3,"input_threshold":-25.38,"target_i":-23,"target_tp":-1,"target_lra":-1,"target_threshold":-1}}},{"id":"soundcloud:tracks:295926514","title":"iSpy feat.
